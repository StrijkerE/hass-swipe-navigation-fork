# Contributing
⚠️ **This file is a draft. Please open an issue if you find difficult to follow the instruction or if you have ideas to improve it.**

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. It is very much appreciated.
This document helps you get started to make your contribution as smooth as possible.

There are 4 steps to start this project:
- [Build the project](#build)
- (Optional) [Start a test instance of Home Assistant](#start-hass)
- (Optional) [Use a test instance of Home Assistant](#use-hass)
- (Optional) [Use your real Home Assistant instance](#use-real-hass)
- (Optional) [Run the tests](#test)

## How to build the project {#build}
There are different ways to run the project based on your preferences.

### Using Docker
Docker is the official and supported way to run the project. It is also the easiest to get started.

#### Plain Docker {#build-plain-docker}
On the root of this repository, run the following command:
```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start the project and expose port `3000`.
The compiled `swipe-navigation.js` file at `http://localhost:3000/swipe-navigation.js`.
The files is continuously compiled as you make changes to the source code.

Now go to [start a test instance of Home Assistant in plain Docker](#start-hass-plain-docker) or [use your own real installation of Home Assistant](#use-real-hass).

#### VSCode Remote Container {#build-vscode}
If you prefer to use vscode to develop, you can use the [Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) extension to run the project in a container.

Select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the command palette.
Open a new terminal inside vscode and run 
```bash
./scripts/build.sh --serve
```
to enable the continuous compilation of the source code.

The compiled `swipe-navigation.js` file at `http://localhost:3000/swipe-navigation.js`.

Now go to [start a test instance of Home Assistant with VSCode Remote Container](#start-hass-vscode) or [use your own real installation of Home Assistant](#use-real-hass).

### Native compilation
Follow the same steps of the [VSCode Remote Container section](#build-vscode), but execute the commands in your system terminal instead of using the container's one.

-----

## Start a test instance of Home Assistant {#start-hass}

### Using Docker
#### Plain Docker {#start-hass-plain-docker}
If you used [plain Docker compilation](#build-plain-docker), the test instance of Home Assistant is already running on port `8123`.

Now go to [use a test instance of Home Assistant](#use-hass).

#### VSCode Remote Container {#start-hass-vscode}
If you used [VSCode Remote Container compilation](#build-vscode), you need to start the test instance of Home Assistant manually.
Open a new terminal in the root of the project of your file system (outside vscode container) and run
```bash
docker compose up hass
```
to start the test instance of Home Assistant.

Now go to [use a test instance of Home Assistant](#use-hass).

-----

## Use a test instance of Home Assistant {#use-hass}
You can access the test instance of Home Assistant at `http://localhost:8123`.
- Default credentials are
  - username: `user`
  - password: `pass`

This test instance is already configured to use the compiled `swipe-navigation.js` file.

Remember to enable to "mobile" mode in your browser to simulate touch events, unless you have a native touch display of course.
Remember also to disable the network cache in your browser to make sure you are using the latest version of the compiled `swipe-navigation.js` file.

-----

## Use your own real installation of Home Assistant {#use-real-hass}
If you prefer to use your own real installation of Home Assistant, you can do so by following these steps:
- Remove the official plugin from HACS (or any other place you installed it from)
- You have to add the resource to Home Assistant UI:
  - Enable `Advanced Mode` in your profile page
  - Go to Dashboard Resources and add the resource `http://localhost:3000/swipe-navigation.js`:
    - _Settings_ → _Dashboards_ → _More Options icon_ → _Resources_ → _Add Resource_ → Set _URL_ as `http://localhost:3000/swipe-navigation.js` → Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
- Remember also to disable the network cache in your browser to make sure you are using the latest version of the compiled `swipe-navigation.js` file.
- Remember to remove the resource when you are done.

-----

## Run the tests {#test}

### Using Docker
#### Plain Docker
To run tests use the following command:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up --exit-code-from tester
```

#### VSCode Remote Container {#test-vscode}
If you're using VSCode Remote Container you can run the tests directly from the container.

[Ensure that you are serving `swipe-navigation.js`](#build-vscode).
[Ensure that the test instance of Home Assistant is running](#start-hass-vscode).

Open a new terminal inside vscode and run
```bash
./scripts/run-playwright.sh
```
to run the tests.

### Native compilation
Follow the same steps of the [VSCode Remote Container section](#test-vscode), but execute the commands in your system terminal instead of using the container's one.

-----

## Troubleshooting
If the compiled code doesn't update, try to delete the `/dist/` folder.
